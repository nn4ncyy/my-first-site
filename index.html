                <h1>I'm Nancy Dinh!</h1>
                <p>It's nice to meet you. I'm a Computer Science student in my last year.
                I've spent the majority of my degree exploring all sectors of the
            tech world, but I think I especially like the world of game development.

                        <h2>No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai</h2>
                        <p>
                            My favourite genre of books is literary fiction, and this book falls in that
                        category. No Longer Human follows a protagonist who is alienated from society, the original
                        Japanese title is literally translated as "disqualified from being human". <br><br>
                        This is my current favourite book because more than any  horror literature, the way Dazai writes 
                        about the human experice of desolate isolation is terrifying. It so greatly delves into the human psyche
                        and explores the scary descent into self destruction.

                    <h2>Us and Them (2018)</h2>
                    <p>
                        My rating: 10/10 <br><br>
                        Us and Them follows a couple and their trials and tribulations that
                        ultimately causes them to drift apart. Some years later, they run
                        into each other and reminisce on what went wrong. <br>
                        This is one of my favourite movies becauses it depicts the realities of life
                        and the realities of relationships. It depicts the rawness of love and human emotion.

                    <p>
                        My rating: 10/10 <br><br>
                        This movie is a masterpiece when it comes to cinematography, pacing, 
                        concepts, casting, and plot. It deals with major themes of class inequality, 
                        racism, police brutality, and companionship. It breaks down class through art while 
                        perfectly portraying the unique experience of youth culture. <br> La Haine is imaginary, 
                        brutal, honest, harsh, and so, so meaningful.

                    <p>
                        My rating: 10/10 <br><br>
                        Children of immigrants will understand what I'm saying when I say this movie
                        heartwrenching. This movie leaves me actually gobsmacked as it deals with themes of
                        optimistic nihilism mixed with intergenerational trauma in an explosive and 
                        meticulously crafted masterpiece.
                        It's funny, sad, action-packed, confusing, beautiful, and hopeful.

                        <p>This song is so eclectic, fun, and melodic. It's one 
                            of those songs I associate heavily with a fun time
                            in my life. I love how whimsical and moving it is!

                        <h3>Lovegod by Sarah Kinsley (2023)</h3>
                        <p>This song is just so epic and fantastical. It takes 
                            me on a trip throughout the song and is a song that
                            just evokes so much emotional. Another moving song.

                        <h3>God Circle by Yves Tumor (2023)</h3>
                        <p>This song is so crunchy and angsty. It reminds me of
                            lot of class rock songs but has this huge experimental
                            twang to it that makes it feel so modern.

                <p>This is the playlist I often listen to when I am studying or 
                    reading. It's a compilation of video game music that
                    plays when the user is fishing. 
                    It's very nostalgic and when doing school work, 
                    it gives me the perfect background noise without being distracting.
